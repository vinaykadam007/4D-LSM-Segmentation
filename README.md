## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **4D light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM)** for the reconstruction and segmentation of cardiac nuclei in zebrafish larvae. By integrating **parallel computing algorithms** with a **3D U-Net segmentation model**, the workflow enables high-resolution, high-speed analysis of myocardial mechanics. The approach significantly enhances visualization of cardiac function and allows efficient large-scale analysis of cellular dynamics.

## 🎯 Objective & Outcome

- **Objective:**  
  Develop a parallelized reconstruction algorithm and 3D U-Net model for accurate segmentation of cardiomyocyte nuclei from 4D LSFM datasets, enabling functional assessment of myocardial mechanics at single-cell resolution.

- **Outcome:**  
  - Achieved **87% segmentation accuracy** of cardiac nuclei.  
  - Reduced reconstruction time from **3 hours to 20 minutes** via parallel computing (10× faster).  
  - Enhanced throughput and memory efficiency, enabling large-scale and real-time cardiac imaging analysis.  
  - Delivered improved visualization of cardiac contractility, aiding comprehensive analysis of myocardial development and regeneration【30†source】.

## ⚙️ Methodology

- **Data Acquisition:** Zebrafish larvae hearts imaged using LSFM, producing 4D datasets (~100GB per acquisition).  
- **Reconstruction:**  
  - Implemented a **parallel computation algorithm** for retrospective synchronization of cardiac cycles.  
  - Optimized memory allocation to prevent fragmentation during reconstruction.  
- **Segmentation:**  
  - Employed **3D U-Net** and **3DeeCellTracker** for nuclei segmentation and tracking.  
  - Leveraged spatial-spectral features to distinguish cardiomyocyte nuclei.  
- **Analysis:**  
  - Quantified myocardial displacement, velocity, and surface-area-to-volume ratios across cardiac phases.  
  - Integrated results into a VR-based visualization platform for interactive exploration of cardiomyocyte dynamics【30†source】.
